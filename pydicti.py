### Global namespace

 - `def build_diciti(base)`: derive case insensitive dictionary class
 - `def Dicti(obj)`: create ci-dict instance using obj's class as base
 - `class dicti = build_dicti(dict)` standard ci-dict
 - `class odicti = build_odicti(OrderedDict)` ordered ci-dict


### Overview

Entries in a `dicti` can be accessed case invariantly:

>>> keys = ['Hello', 'beautiful', 'world!']
>>> values = [1, 2, 3]
>>> z = list(zip(keys, values))
>>> i = dicti(z)
>>> assert "WorLD!" in i and "universe" not in i
>>> assert i.get('hEllo') == 1

However, the in calls like `.keys()` or `.items()` the keys are returned
as in their original case:

>>> assert "Hello" in list(i.keys())

`dicti` can be "derived" from  another custom dictionary extension using
it as the underlying dictionary to gain additional properties like order
preservation:

>>> from collections import OrderedDict
>>> odicti = build_dicti(OrderedDict)
>>> oi = odicti(z)
>>> assert list(oi.keys()) == keys

The equality  comparison preserves  the semantics of  the base  type and
reflexitivity as best  as possible. This has impact  on the transitivity
of the comparison operator:

>>> rz = list(zip(reversed(keys), reversed(values)))
>>> roi = odicti(rz)
>>> assert roi == i and i == oi
>>> assert oi != roi and roi != oi  # NOT transitive!
>>> assert oi == i and i == oi      # reflexive

Be careful  with reflexitivity when  comparing to non-`dicti`  types and
even more so if both operands are  not subclasses of each other. Here it
is important  to know about  coercion rules.  `o == oli`  actually calls
`oli.__eq__(o)` if `oli` is of a subclass of the type of of `o`. See:

http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#coercion-rules

>>> o = OrderedDict(oi)
>>> oli = Dicti(oi.lower_dict())
>>> assert oli == o and o == oli    # reflexive (coercion rules)
>>> print(o.__eq__(oli))            # dependends on OrderedDict.__eq__
False

Note that `dicti` is the type corresponding to `builtins.dict`:

>>> assert build_dicti(dict) is dicti

The  method   `Dicti`  is  convenient  for   creating  case  insensitive
dictionaries from a given object automatically using the objects type as
the underlying dictionary type.

>>> assert oi == Dicti(o)
>>> assert type(oi) is type(Dicti(o))

The  subclassing approach  works well  with "badly"  written code  as in
`json` that checks for `isinstance(dict)`:

>>> import json
>>> assert oi == json.loads(json.dumps(oi), object_pairs_hook=odicti)

        Dictionary with case insensitive lookups.

        Behaves like  `dict` except  that lookups  are always  done case
        insensitive. Case sensitivity  is retained in so  far that calls
        like `.keys()` or  `.items()` return the keys  in their original
        form.

        Passing  dictionaries   that  have  multiple  keys   with  equal
        `.lower()`-case  to  the  constructor,   to  `.update()`  or  to
        `.__eq__()` is undefined behaviour.

        Note  that `dicti`  is  inherited  from `builtins.dict`  instead
        of   from   `collections.MutableMapping`.    This   means   that
        `isinstance(d,dict)` checks will  succeed and `json.dump()` will
        work automatically with `dicti`.


        Implementation rationale (known pitfalls):

        When subclassing `builtins.dict`,  calling `dict(Dicti(v))` will
        bypass  the `__iter__`+`__getitem__`  interface  and access  the
        'internal' (inherited) dictionary. See:

        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18317905/overloaded-iter-is-bypassed-when-deriving-from-dict

        When subclassing  `dict`, it is  therefore necessary to  set the
        internal dictionary such  that it can be  converted back without
        problem. This easiest  way to do this is a  two step key lookup.
        The  internal dictionary  stores  (original_case  => value)  and
        another is used to store (lower_case => original_case).
