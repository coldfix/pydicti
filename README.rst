pydicti
-------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install the newest version of *pydicti* from PyPI:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pydicti

Alternatively, you can just take the file ``pydicti.py`` and redistribute
it with your application.


Overview
~~~~~~~~

- ``class dicti``: default case insensitive dictionary type
- ``class odicti``: ordered case insensitive dictionary type
- ``def build_dicti``: create a case insensitive dictionary class
- ``def Dicti``: create a case insensitive copy of a dictionary

dicti
=====

Object of type ``dicti`` are dictionaries that feature case insensitive
item access:

.. code:: python

    >>> d = dicti(Hello='foo', world='bar')
    >>> d['heLLO']
    'foo'
    >>> 'WOrld' in d
    True

Internally however, the keys retain their original case:

.. code:: python

    >>> sorted(d.keys())
    ['Hello', 'world']

odicti
======

The type ``odicti`` instanciates order-preserving case insensitive
dictionaries. It is available if either `collections.OrderedDict`_ or
`ordereddict.OrderedDict`_ exists:

.. code:: python

    >>> odicti(zip('abc', range(3)))
    Dicti(OrderedDict([('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)]))

.. _`collections.OrderedDict`: http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict
.. _`ordereddict.OrderedDict`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ordereddict/1.1

build_dicti
===========

With ``build_dicti`` you can create custom case insensitive dictionaries.
This function is what is used to create the ``pydicti.dicti`` and
``pydicti.odicti`` types. Note that calling ``build_dicti`` several times
with the same argument will result in identical types:

.. code:: python

    >>> build_dicti(dict) is dicti
    True
    >>> build_dicti(OrderedDict) is odicti
    True

``build_dicti`` uses subclassing to inherit the semantics of the given base
dictionary type:

.. code:: python

    >>> issubclass(odicti, OrderedDict)
    True

Dicti
=====

The function ``Dicti`` is convenient for creating case insensitive
copies of dictionary instances:

.. code:: python

    >>> o = OrderedDict(zip('abcdefg', range(7)))
    >>> oi = Dicti(o)
    >>> type(oi) is odicti
    True


JSON
~~~~

The subclassing approach allows to plug your dictionary instance into
places where typechecking with ``isinstance`` is used, like in the json_
module:

.. code:: python

    >>> import json
    >>> d == json.loads(json.dumps(d), object_hook=dicti)
    True

.. _json: http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/json.html

Above python26 you can use ``json.loads(s, object_pairs_hook=odicti)`` to
deserialize ordered dictionaries.


Pitfalls
~~~~~~~~

The equality comparison tries preserves the semantics of the base type as
well as reflexitivity. This has impact on the transitivity of the
comparison operator:

.. code:: python

    >>> i = dicti(oi)
    >>> roi = odicti(reversed(list(oi.items())))
    >>> roi == i and i == oi
    True
    >>> oi != roi and roi != oi  # NOT transitive!
    True
    >>> oi == i and i == oi      # reflexive
    True

The `coercion rules`_ in python allow this to work pretty well when
performing comparisons between types that are subclasses of each other. Be
careful otherwise, however.
